# Phase 1: Networking and cloud fundamentals

## How does this phase apply to Cyber Security?

Cybersecurity is the overall umbrella term. It involves securing everything, including the network. Because all devices in the world are connected to  each others by a network. So it is crucial to understand how networks works. And now many companies are getting into cloud technology. So its crucial to learn how cloud works and how to defend it. If you're already a network engineer or cloud engineer, then you can apply your skills to Cyber Security.

## Certifications you might want to look into

There are TONS of networking certifications out there, and they are more focused on giving you a lot of knowledge so you can become a networking engineer/specialist, again at an introductory level, it's a little overkill. If you did want to get one, take a look at the [Cisco certifications](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html) which are pretty much industry standard and/or [Comptia Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network). And for cloud fundamentals, you can take [Microsoft AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) (You can claim free exam vouchers by attending virtual workshop condudcted by Microsoft. Refer google for more info).

At the end of the day, its overkill. But if you want to take them, go for it :)
