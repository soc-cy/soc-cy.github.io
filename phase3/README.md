## Certifications you might want to look into

There are TONS of Cyber Security certifications out there. If you did want to get one, take a look at the [Comptia Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) or [EC-Council: Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) which are pretty much industry standard.

At the end of the day, if you want to take them, go for it :)
  
## What's next

This is the end of Cyber Security Basics. And we will continuously keep on adding/updating the resourses. We hope the above topics will give you enough knowledge and confident about cyber security and now, you can go and apply for security related jobs. All the best for your job search!
