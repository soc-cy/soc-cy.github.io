# Phase 2: Linux fundamentals

## How does this phase apply to Cyber Security?

Most of the servers use Linux OS. And the cloud is a bunch of Linux Servers networked together. Learning the fundamentals how to interact with these servers via commands, is what this phase is about. If you're already a Linux admin, then you can apply your skills to the Cyber Security.

## Certifications you might want to look into

There are several Linux certifications and you can chose to study for any of them really, but a lot of them cover WAY more than what you need to know for a solid foundation and are more focused on Linux administration.

- [LPI essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview)
- [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training-and-certification)
- [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification-catalog/)
- [Oracle](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certification-path/pFamily_358)
- [LPI](https://www.lpi.org/)
- [Comptia Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)


Note: It's a overkill. But at the end of the day, if you want to take them, go for it :) Its not mandatory.
