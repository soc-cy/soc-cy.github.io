# Phase 0: Starting from zero

## How does this phase apply to Cyber Security?

If you feel like you have zero tech experience but you want to get into Cyber Security. This phase is for you. If you are already in tech and switching to Cyber Security, [Go to Phase 1: Networking and Linux fundamentals](../phase1/README.md).


Let's get started. 

1. I think a good first step is understanding the fundamentals of IT and [this video](https://youtu.be/awLnur5Yt9o) is a fantastic overview.

2. The above video should give you some understanding of the following but let's dive in a little more and understand what some of the fundamentals of Cloud are.

   - [What is Networking](https://youtu.be/3QhU9jd03a0)
   - [What is Programming](https://youtu.be/ifo76VyrBYo)



## Things you should be able familiar with at the end of this phase

- Honestly at this point, all you need to make sure of is that you want to get into tech and you're prepared to learn a lot. The learning will never stop.


## Certifications you might want to look into 

An industry standard certification for people getting into tech is the [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a).

Is it necessary? No. Is it helpful? Depends on your learning style. Did I take the A+? Also no. Does that mean you shouldn't take it? No. Does it help your resume? Maybe.

However some people have told me that it's helped them land support roles like 

- Service Desk Analyst
- Help Desk Tech
- Desktop Support Administrator
- Technical Support Specialist
- End User Computing Technician
- Field Service Technician
- Help Desk Technician 
- System Support Specialist

## Jobs

They are entry level friendly and often are willing to pay for educational material and certifications. 

Also almost every company has a helpdesk, so plenty of openings to get started in!

Take a look at this video by KevTech on [Helpdesk interview questions](https://youtu.be/McxVgoQaCpU). Binge watch his channel because he has so much great content!
