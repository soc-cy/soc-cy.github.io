### One Stop to learn Cyber Security Fundamentals


SOCCY is not a book or course. Its a free GUIDE  based on our experiences. The goal is to provide an outline of skills you need to learn to get into Cyber Secuirty. At the end of it you should have the basic technical knowledge for roles like:

- SOC Analsyst
- Cyber Secuirty Analyst
- Information Security Analyst

We tried to keep it as general and using the most popular options (in terms of content, community, and jobs) as possible.
